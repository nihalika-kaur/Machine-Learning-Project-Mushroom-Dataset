# Machine-Learning-Project-Mushroom-Dataset
Took a dataset containing information about 23 types of gilled mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota Families. Performed a basic classification analysis on the dataset using a decision tree algorithm to determine edibility. I got an accuracy of 1.00 (100%) for the model.
